    <p>This form POST tester was initially created for my <a href="https://www.weareimd.be">web development students</a> but can be handy for anyone learning about HTML forms.</p>
    <p>Code for this tool is open source and can be found on <a href="https://github.com/iamgoodbytes/form-post-tester">github</a> (expect nothing fancy). Find me at <a href="https://www.goodbytes.be" title="Security &amp; Privacy focused web developer">GoodBytes</a>.</p>
